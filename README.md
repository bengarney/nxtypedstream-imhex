# nxtypedstream-imhex

imhex pattern implementation for reading nxtypedstream data as found
in some Messages.app chat records and other strange places in macOS.

Not heavily tested, but works pretty well. Does a neat thing with imhex
sections to store data for backreferences, perhaps the most interesting
thing here.

Thanks to dgelessus and the python-typedstream package they released!
